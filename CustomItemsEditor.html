			<h2>Custom Items Editor</h2>

			<p>The Custom Items Editor can be accessed via the Edit menu.</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image1.png"></p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image2.png"></p>
			<p>The Custom Items Editor will then pop up. Note you will not be
			able to click outside of the popup window while it's open.</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image3.png" width="70%"></p>
			<p>At the bottom of the window are the buttons for interacting with
			the editor.</p>
			<p>You can add a new item with the ADD button<p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image4.png"></p>
			<p>A window will pop up asking you to enter in the new item's description.
			This is the description as it will appear in the document.</p>
			<p><em>Note: you cannot give two items the same description, and custom
			items cannot have the same description as the existing default items. Costs
			Drawer will prevent you from doing so and show an error message.</em></p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image5.png"></p>
			<p>The new item will appear in the list as shown below.</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image6.png" width="70%"></p>
			<p>When an item is in the list, you can then select the outlay and
			professional values for editing. Simply double click on the area,
			or navigate using the keyboard arrow keys and press enter. (Note
			this also works for editing the description if you wish to change it.)</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image7.png"></p>
			<p>Editing the outlay and professional values works the same way as
			entering the description.</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image8.png"></p>
			<p>You can see the item outlay has now been changed.</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image9.png"></p>
			<p>You can add as many items as you need.</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image10.png"></p>
			<p>To delete an item, simply make sure you have the correct item highlighted,
			either using the mouse or the keyboard, then click on DELETE.</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image11.png"></p>
			<p>You will be asked to confirm the deletion. Make sure to double check the
			description is for the correct item.</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image12.png"></p>
			<p>Items created in the Custom Items Editor will be automatically added to the
			bottom of the Items list in the right column. The order of the items shown in
			editor is the order the items will appear in the list. You can move items up or
			down this list if you want to make one easier to get to. Simply select the item
			you want to move...</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image13.png"></p>
			<p><em>Note that if you hover over an item, you can see the full description as a
			tooltip.</em></p>
			<p>And press either of the MOVE buttons (arrows indicate the direction). </p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image14.png"></p>
			<p>Now the item with the description "This is a second item." has been moved up
			the list.</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image15.png"></p>
			<p>When a change has been made to the list, the SAVE button will appear. You must
			click on this button to save your changes to the list.</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image16.png"></p>
			<p>Closing the editor is done via the CLOSE button. If you have made changes and 
			haven't saved yet, you will be asked to confirm that you wish to close without
			saving your changes.</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image17.png"></p>
			<p>When you close the editor, scroll to the bottom of the Items list in the right column
			area to see them. Double-clicking on one will insert it into the document at the current
			position, just as with any other items.</p>
			<p><img src="images/customitemseditor/image18.png"></p>
			<p><b>FINAL NOTE:</b> Circuit Court and High Court have separate items lists, so if you want an item
			to be available in both, you must add it to both manually. The Custom Items List you are
			editing depends on the jurisdicition of the bill you are currently editing.</p>
