-START TIPS-
You can increase or decrease the size of the right column text and toolbar buttons by selecting “Toggle Small Screen Mode” from the View menu at the top of the window.;
Item professional and outlay amounts in proceedings taken after April 2019 are considered discretionary, so default values in proceedings from that date onwards can be considered as just a guide. Proceedings prior to this date are more strictly held to the suggested amounts.;
Caution: On taxation of S&C costs, or where a Bill is being taxed for the purpose of deducting such costs for the funds of an Estate or the assets of a Company in Liquidation, and the costs claimed are reduced by 15% or more, then the costs of taxation are payable by the solicitor presenting the Bill!;
Costs Drawer will remember many settings between runs, such as window position and size, how zoomed in the document is, and whether “Small Screen Mode” is on or off.;
It can be difficult to find a particular item in a large bill, so now you can search for specific text using the search bar at the top of the window when editing a document.;
