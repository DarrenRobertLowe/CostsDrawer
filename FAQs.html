			<p class="question">Q) Nothing happens when I click on "print"</p>
			<p class="answer">Q) Please ensure that you have Excel or equivalent spreadsheet software installed on your computer, and that your default printer is set correctly. Both are required for printing directly from Costs Drawer.</p>
			<p class="question">Q) I printed a pdf file using Costs Drawer and the pdf file was empty.</p>
			<p class="answer">A) Sometimes it can take a few seconds for the pdf to be fully printed, even after the pdf file itself appears to be created! Try waiting about 10 seconds before opening it again.</p>
			<p class="question">Q) The printed pdf just says the text "Generated" "PK" and "Page 1"</p>
			<p class="answer">A) Without closing the currently opened document, try printing it again. If that resolves the issue, please increase PRINT WAIT time in preferences. If the issue persists, ask your system administrator to ensure that the Costs Drawer AppData folder is not write-protected. In the meantime, export as xlsx instead and print the document from your spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel)</p>
